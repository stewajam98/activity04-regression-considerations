## Loading in the Data

```{R, warnings=FALSE}
evals <- readr::read_delim("https://www.openintro.org/data/tab-delimited/evals.txt")

evals %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = score)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

  1. Observational study. They did not assign these individuals for the experiment and control for the professors looks. They observed the results afterwards.
  2. The data for score looks skewed to the left.
  3. See following code chunk. It looks like upper level classes have more students.

```{R}
evals %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cls_level, y = cls_students)) +
  geom_col()
```


## Pairwise Relationships

```{R}
evals %>%
  select(contains("bty")) %>%
  ggpairs()
```

  4. They seem to all be positively correlated and have either a linear or curvalinear relationship.
  5. It does not make sense to have all of these variables in the same model because they would be describing the same variance.
  6. I would only include the bty_avg variable as it seems to be strongly correlated with all of the other variables. If I was to add another variable, it would have to be bty_m2upp as it is the least correlated with the bty_avg.
  
## Task 5 - One Quant, One Qual Variable

```{R}
m_bty_gen <- lm(score ~ bty_avg + gender, data = evals)
tidy(m_bty_gen)
```

  7. See code chunk below. Overall, it looks skewed to the left. This could mean that a transformation on the data might yield a better model. Constant variance and linearity don't seem to be much of an issue.
  
```{R}
# obtain fitted values and residuals
m_bty_aug <- augment(m_bty_gen)

# plot fitted values and residuals
ggplot(data = m_bty_aug, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")

ggplot(data = m_bty_aug, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25) +
  xlab("Residual")
```

  8. Both bty_avg and gender seem to be significant predictors of score.
  9. yhat = 3.919 + 0.07415*bty_avg
  10. males tend to receive higher score. You can tell because gendermale's beta value is positive.

```{R}
m_bty_rank <- lm(score ~ bty_avg + rank, data = evals)
tidy(m_bty_rank)
```
